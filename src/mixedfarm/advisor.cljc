  "Mixed Crop and Livestock Farm Labourer Advisor — proposing a farm
  scheduling/logistics coordination operation (log a planting/harvest/
  feeding-log/progress record, schedule a crew operation, flag a safety
  concern, coordinate a seed/feed/farm-supplies procurement order) from a
  crew roster, farm registration and safety-reporting policy. Swappable
  mock/llm; the advisor ONLY proposes — `mixedfarm.governor`
  independently gates every proposal and always escalates safety
  concerns and above-threshold supply orders. The advisor never proposes
  to directly finalize a livestock-handling-execution decision (e.g.
  approving a specific handling or restraint procedure), a crop-
  handling-execution decision (e.g. approving a specific planting or
  harvest-handling procedure), or a farm-safety-clearance decision (e.g.
  declaring a farm cleared for safety), and never proposes to override a
  farm safety supervisor's judgment — those stay permanently out of this
  actor's scope. Modeled closely on cloud-itonami-isco-9212's
  livestockfarm.advisor for the animal-handling hazard-domain shape,
  extended with a second, independent crop-handling-execution scope-
  exclusion dimension.
