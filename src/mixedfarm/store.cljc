  "SSoT for the ISCO-08 9213 mixed crop and livestock farm scheduling/
  logistics coordination actor (itonami actor pattern, ADR-2607121000 /
  CLAUDE.md Actors section; README's 'Robotics premise' — a farm
  scheduling/logistics coordination robot manages crew scheduling,
  planting/harvest/feeding-log/progress-record logging and seed/feed/
  farm-supplies procurement coordination for a mixed crop-and-livestock
  farm crew under this advisor/governor pair, which never dispatches
  hardware itself, never handles crops or livestock itself, and never
  finalizes a livestock-handling-execution decision, a crop-handling-
  execution decision or a farm-safety-clearance decision, and never
  overrides a farm safety supervisor's judgment — those remain the farm
  safety supervisor's exclusive judgment). Modeled closely on
  cloud-itonami-isco-9212's livestockfarm.store for the animal-handling
  hazard-domain shape, extended with a second, independent crop-handling-
  execution scope-exclusion dimension (mixed crop and livestock farm
  labourers perform combined crop AND livestock manual farm labour, so
  both a livestock-handling-execution scope-exclusion and a crop-
  handling-execution scope-exclusion apply, stacked on top of the
  outdoor-exposure/farm-equipment hazard shared with 9212).

  Domain:

    worker — a registered mixed crop-and-livestock farm crew member
             (:worker-id, :name)
    farm   — a registered mixed crop-and-livestock farm {:farm-id :name
             :max-supply-cost number}. `:max-supply-cost` is an
             informational registered ceiling used only to decide whether
             a `:coordinate-supply-order` proposal escalates to human
             sign-off (the governor never blocks a within-threshold order
             outright; it only decides commit vs. escalate).
    record — a committed operating record (a logged planting/harvest/
             feeding-log/progress entry, a scheduled crew operation, a
             flagged safety concern, or a coordinated supply order) —
             written ONLY via commit-record!.
    ledger — append-only audit trail, commit or hold.")
